<p><em>Lunatics with Sean Crain</em> was the planned political show we planned on doing back in 2015. However, with the new member base coming, having Lunatics begin airing as a Friday night livestream is becoming a more attractive option. While we don't have a set date yet, if all goes as we want to, Lunatics will begin its first livestream on Friday, September 21, 2018 at 11pm Central/12am Eastern.</p>
<p>The panelists will consist of Sean Atchinson, who will not be available for the first few episodes, Charles Routh, Noah Joseph, and we have more people who we'd like to have join in later episodes. While not confirmed, possible future panelists could include Ruffer of the Nosiphus Discord server and Weston Simpson.</p>
