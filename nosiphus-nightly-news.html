	<p>From Nosiphus World Headquarters in Midton, this is <i>Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain.</i></p>
	
	<p>From February 28 to September 13 of 2015, those words or a variation of them were uttered at the start of every video we made. They were meant to make the Recent as of posts obsolete, and during that time period, they did.</p>
	
	<p>A lot of things have changed since the last time Sean Crain anchored the newscast. Nosiphus went through an expansionist phase followed by a sharp retraction of that, a communications platform shift, not to mention the countless personal things that happened for each of us.</p>
	
	<p>Just before the <em>Lunatics</em> livestreams in late 2018, <em>Nosiphus Nightly News</em> made a one-show return on September 11 to announce the upcoming streams. On September 30, 2019, a new logo with the updated Nosiphus jack was finally created.</p>
