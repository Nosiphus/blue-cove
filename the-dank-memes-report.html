	<p><i>The Dank Memes Report</i> was recorded in July 2016 after Wyatt Mote wanted to release videos in a similar fashion to Nate Sawyers' <i>Conspiracies with Nate</i> in December 2015. Two videos were released and three more were recorded. This series has been cancelled since the departure of Wyatt Mote on September 11, 2018.</p>
